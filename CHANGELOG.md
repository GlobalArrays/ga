# Change Log
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

This project follows the [Gitflow Workflow model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

## [Unreleased]
The Unreleased section will be empty for tagged releases. Unreleased functionality appears in the develop branch.

-Added
  - Version function that can be used to report the current version, subversion
    and patch numbers of the current release

## [5.7] - 2018-03-30
- Known Bugs
  - Some combinations of MPI implementations with the MPI RMA and PR
    ports fail. Recommended to use latest MPI implementations available.
- Added
  - Tiled data layout
  - Read-only property type using replication across SMP nodes
- Changed
  - GA is now thread safe
  - MPI3 implementation based on MPI RMA now uses data types in MPI
    calls by default. This is higher performing but not as reliable as
    using multiple contiguous data transfers. The build can be
    configured to use contiguous transfers if data types are not working
    for your MPI implementation.
  - ComEx MPI-PR now uses MPI data types in strided put and get calls
    by default. To enable the old packed behavior, set the following
    environment variables to 0.
    
    - COMEX_ENABLE_PUT_DATATYPE
    - COMEX_ENABLE_GET_DATATYPE
    
    Additionally, the original packing implementation is faster for smaller
    messages. Two new environment variables control at which point the MPI
    data types are used.
    
    - COMEX_PUT_DATATYPE_THRESHOLD. Default 8192.
    - COMEX_GET_DATATYPE_THRESHOLD. Default 8192.
- Fixed
  - Message sizes exceeding 2GB now work correctly
  - Mirrored Arrays now distributes data across SMP nodes for
    ComEx-based runtimes
  - Matrix multiply works for non-standard data layouts (may not be
    performant)
- Closed Issues
  - \[#48] Message sizes exceeding 2GB may not work correctly

## [5.6.5] - 2018-03-29
- Known Bugs
  - [\#48] Message sizes exceeding 2GB may not work correctly
- Added
  - Environment variables to control internal ComEx MPI-PR settings
    - COMEX_MAX_NB_OUTSTANDING. Default 8.
      The maximum number of concurrent non-blocking operations.
    - COMEX_STATIC_BUFFER_SIZE. Default 2097152 bytes.
      Some ComEx operations require a temporary buffer. Any message larger than this size will dynamically allocate and free a new buffer to hold the larger message.
    - COMEX_EAGER_THRESHOLD. Default -1.
      Small messages can be sent as part of other internal ComEx operations. Recommended to set this to less than or equal to the corresponding MPI eager/rendezvous threshold cutoff.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_PUT_SELF. Default 1 (on). Contiguous put will use memcpy when target is same as originator.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_GET_SELF. Default 1 (on). Contiguous get will use memcpy when target is same as originator.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_ACC_SELF. Default 1 (on). Contiguous acc will use memcpy when target is same as originator.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_PUT_SMP. Default 1 (on). Contiguous put will use memcpy when target is on the same host via shared memory.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_GET_SMP. Default 1 (on). Contiguous get will use memcpy when target is on the same host via shared memory.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_ACC_SMP. Default 1 (on). Contiguous acc will use memcpy when target is on the same host via shared memory.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_PUT_PACKED. Default 1 (on). Strided put will pack the data into a contiguous buffer.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_GET_PACKED. Default 1 (on). Strided get will pack the data into a contiguous buffer.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_ACC_PACKED. Default 1 (on). Strided acc will pack the data into a contiguous buffer.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_PUT_IOV. Default 1 (on). Vector put will pack the data into a contiguous buffer.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_GET_IOV. Default 1 (on). Vector get will pack the data into a contiguous buffer.
    - COMEX_ENABLE_ACC_IOV. Default 1 (on). Vector acc will pack the data into a contiguous buffer.
    - COMEX_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE. Default INT_MAX. All use of MPI will keep buffers less than this size. Sometimes useful in conjunction with eager thresholds to force all use of MPI below the eager threshold.
