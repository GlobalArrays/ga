# GA_CROSS_COMPILING
# ------------------
# The standard check for whether we are cross compiling is not sufficient.
# We know certain platforms are only cross compiled.  Make the fix here.
# This could be expanded later to avoid using GA_TARGET and instead perform
# a more rigorous cross compiling test case.
