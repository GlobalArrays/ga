ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This directory contains the Global Arrays (GA), ARMCI run-time library, and
Memory Allocator (MA), parallel I/O libraries (DRA,EAF,SF),
TCGMSG, and TCGMSG-MPI packages bundled together. 

  Global Arrays is a portable Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) shared-
  memory programming environment for distributed and shared memory 
  computers. It augments the message-passing model by providing
  a shared-memory like access to distributed dense arrays.

  ARMCI provides one-sided remote memory operations used by GA.

  DRA (Disk Resident Arrays) is a parallel I/O library
  that maintains dense 2-dim arrays on disk. 

  SF (Shared Files) is a parallel I/O library that allows
  noncollective I/O to a parallel file.

  EAF (Exclusive Access Files) is parallel I/O library that 
  supports I/O to private files.

  TCGMSG is a simple, efficient, but becoming obsolete message-passing library.

  TCGMSG-MPI is a TCGMSG interface implementation on top of MPI and ARMCI. 

  MA is a dynamic memory allocator/manager for Fortran and C programs.

  GA++ is a C++ binding for global arrays.

HOW TO BUILD THE PACKAGE?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. MAKE program
You can build GA, ARMCI, MA and TCGMSG libraries separately or all libraries
and (a subset of) test programs automatically. To build the GA library, you 
need GNU make version >3.68. On the native Windows NT/2000 (not Cygwin/Interix) 
the Microsoft's nmake is used.

To learn if your default make is a GNU make, try to invoke it with the -v
flag.  At some sites, GNU make is installed under the name of
"gmake" or "gnumake". If none of these is located in your default
path, you can also try /usr/local/bin or other location where GNU
programs might be stored.

2. Configuration variables
The GA package relies on the GNU make capabilities supplemented by by
user provided environment variables. In the future we are planning to employ 
autoconf to simplify the installation.

The currently recognized environment variables:

   Name           Type       Platforms      Meaning
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   TARGET        mandatory    all          indentifies the platform name
   TARGET_CPU    optional     SGI          specifies CPU for better optimization
                 optional     LINUX/Ultra  selects CPU flavor of the OS
                 optional     LINUX/PowerPC         "
   ARMCI_NETWORK optional     LINUX,DECOSF selects communication protocols
                              SOLARIS
   USE_MPI       optional     all          selects MPI message passing library
   MPI_INCLUDE   optional     all          see next section 
   MPI_LIB       optional     all          see next section
   LIBMPI        optional     all          overwrites -lmpi when linking
   LARGE_FILES   optional     64-bit OSes  allows to use large >2Gb file APIs
   CC            optional     all          overwrite default C compiler name
   FC            optional     all          overwrite fortran compiler name
   COPT          optional     all          overwrite default C compler flags 
   FOPT          optional     all          overwrite default fortran comp flags 
   OLD_G77       optional     LINUX        drops more recent flags for g77

   
3. Fast path to building the package (default compilers and settings)

NOTE: the instructions below assume that you are not compiling for clusters
equipped with special networks such as Myrinet, Quadrics, or Giganet. If you do,
you will have to refer to files in armci/doc directory for instructions
on building ARMCI (a run-time library for GA) to exploit these networks.
Otherwise, GA will not be able to used them effectively or might even hang.

GA can be built to work with MPI or TCGMSG. Since the TCGMSG package is
small (comparing to portable MPI implementations), compiles fast, it is 
still bundled with the GA package.  If this is acceptable, you 
ONLY NEED TO CALL GNU MAKE IN THE TOP DIRECTORY specifying TARGET platform

   gmake TARGET=xxxx

or a better solution (for C shell users) is

   setenv TARGET xxxx
   gmake

   where xxxx is your machine. The list of supported machines is:
        SOLARIS (Sun or Fujitsu running Solaris operating system)
        SOLARIS64 (Sun or Fujitsu running Solaris operating system)
        SGI (older 32-bit Mips-2 and Mips-3 SGI systems)
        SGI_N32 (64-bit Mips-4 processors, 32-bit address space, fastest code)
        SGITFP (all SGI systems with 64-bit address space) 
        DECOSF (DEC/Compaq Alpha running OSF/Tru64)
        IBM, IBM64 (IBM workstations/servers but NOT SP), 
        LAPI (IBM SP with PSSP > 2.2 on top of LAPI Active Messages)
        CRAY-T3E 
        CRAY-YMP (J90)
        CRAY-SV1
        LINUX  (Intel, PowerPC, Ultra procesors with kernel >2.0)
        LINUX64 (Alpha processor with Compaq compiler but not gcc/g77 and IA64)
        FUJITSU-VPP (VX/VPP)
        HPUX, HPUX64 (HP UNIX; bad luck if you got the free HP cc compiler!)
        WIN32 (Intel, Windows NT using Windows compilers and MS nmake)
        CYGNUS (Intel, Windows NT + Cygnus Unix interface)
        HITACHI (HITACHI SR8000 System) 
   Obsolete target platforms on which GA was supported in previous releases:
        KSR (KSR-1/2)
        IPSC, DELTA, PARAGON
        SUN (SunOS 4.X) 
        SP (IBM SP under the native IBM message-passing library, MPL)

If you have one of those, an older version GA 2.4 might still still work. 
Otherwise please contact us for help.

The GA test program will be created in ./global/testing/test.x.


4. Message-passing library support for this package 

library    suported platforms                     notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MPI          All                                 -
  TCGMSG       Sun, IBM, SP, SGI, HPUX, Compaq   can use TCGMSG-MPI on others
           
If you would like to build the MPI version of GA on a platform that does
not have a vendor implementation of MPI and/or its header and library
files are installed in non-standard locations, you need to:
. provide locations of MPI include (MPI_INCLUDE) and library (MPI_LIB) files,
. define an environment variable USE_MPI, and then 
. call GNU make as described above. 
This will built a version that allows using both the MPI and TCGMSG
functions in the same program. See README file in ./global for
instructions on how to built GA package with MPI and without the
TCGMSG-MPI library. If the vendor of your machine provides MPI, and the
include and library files are located in the standard system
directories, you need to define only USE_MPI variable.

TARGET, MPI_INCLUDE, MPI_LIB, USE_MPI can be defined as environment
variables, for example under the C shell:
 
     setenv TARGET SUN
     setenv MPI_INCLUDE /usr/local/mpich/include          (location of mpi.h)
     setenv MPI_LIB /usr/local/mpich/lib/sun/ch_shmem  (location of libmpi.a)
     setenv USE_MPI yes

  or directly on the command line when calling GNU make, for example:

       gmake TARGET=SUN MPI_INCLUDE=/usr/local/mpich/include \
             MPI_LIB=/usr/local/mpich/lib/sun/ch_shmem USE_MPI=yes

If the MPI library you are using is not named libmpi.a you might need
to define an additional variable LIBMPI, for example

     gmake LIBMPI=-lmpich

Some versions (1.1.X) of MPICH (an MPI implementation from ANL/Missisipi State) 
keep the MPI header files in more than one directory. One can :

.    specify in MPI_INCLUDE a list of directories separated by comma
     e.g., setenv MPI_INCLUDE "/usr/local/include,/usr/local/mpich/build/alpha",
     or  
.    use mpicc and mpif77 to build GA right out of the box on UNIX 
     workstations:

        make FC=mpif77 CC=mpicc
or 
        make FC=/usr/local/bin/mpif77 CC=/usr/local/bin/mpicc LIBMPI=-lmpich

One disadvantage of the second approach it that GA makefile might be not able
to determine which compiler (e.g., GNU or PGI) is called underneath
by the MPICH compiler wrappers. This could cause the package to build 
incorrectly (test programs do not compile/link).

5. Compiler issues 
 
Unless otherwise noted (LINUX64) you can try to overwrite the default
compiler names by defining FC for Fortran and CC for C compilers e.g.,
"make FC=f90 CC=gcc"

With older version of g77 on Linux, define OLD_G77 to avoid problems
with compiler not recognizing some newer options

What compiler/platform configurations were tested and should work:
 - compilers provided by the vendor of your OS/hardware
 - gcc/g77 pair on LINUX (but not LINUX64/alpha where use Compaq compilers)
 - Portland Group (PGI) fortran compilers (pgf77 and pgf90) on Linux/Intel
   Note that PGI cc version 3.1 has bugs in varargs.h header file.


6. Special networks and communication protocols

For Myrinet-based Linux clusters and Quadrix-based Compaq Alphaserver
clusters, ARMCI library needs to be informed that you want to use
the non-default (i.e., TCP/IP socket) communication protocols.
This is critical to assure that the appropriate high-performance
protocols are used.

For Myrinet, define ARMCI_NETWORK=GM,  GM_LIB and GM_INCLUDE definitions
for the location of the Myricom GM library and header files.
Please refer to armci/doc/README.myrinet for installation details.

For Quadrics (QsNet1), define ARMCI_NETWORK=QUADRICS or ARMCI_NETWORK=ELAN3. 
For Quadrics (QsNet2), define ARMCI_NETWORK=ELAN4. 
You can also specify QUADRICS_INCLUDE and QUADRICS_LIB for nonstandard 
installation of the libraries.

For Infiniband (VAPI), define ARMCI_NETWORK=MELLANOX. You can also specify 
IB_INCLUDE and IB_LIB for nonstandard installation of the libraries. 


7. Other issues 

(a) LINUX64 supports ALPHA, Itanium, Opteron, and Em64T processors only. 

(b) The SGI_N32 version is recommended on all newer SGI boxes including
the O2, Octane, Origin, Indigo2, and PowerChallenge systems
unless the system has lots of memory and your program uses 
huge arrays (>4GB) in which case 64-bit addressing is required
(SGITFP version). In addition, TARGET_CPU environment
variable can be used to choose the optimal compiler flags 
for R8000 and R10000 processors.

(c) In 64 bit platforms, if you are using blas libraries that takes
integer as 8 bytes, then set the following environment variables:
	setenv BLAS_I8 yes
	setenv BLAS_LIB specify_your_blas_library
		e.g.setenv BLAS_LIB -L/usr/lib/libblas.a

(d) support for two underscores in fortran names on Linux/Cygwin
    is enabled by setting F2C_TWO_UNDERSCORES.
          (e.g. setenv F2C_TWO_UNDERSCORES 1)

(e) To turn Async I/O on under Linux, set environment variable USE_LINUXAIO=y

8. Performance tuning

global/src/config.h has a varible called AVOID_MA_STORAGE. If defined, this
variable forces GA to use ARMCI memory which can lead to better performance
on platfomrs on which memory needs to be registered for fast communication

setting an environment variable MA_USE_ARMCI_MEM forces MA library to use
ARMCI memory, communication via which can be faster on networks like GM, 
VIA and InfiniBand

SUBDIRECTORIES:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This directory contains Global Arrays (GA), ARMCI, Memory Allocator (MA),
TCGMSG, and TCGMSG-MPI packages bundled together.

./global directory contains the source code for the GA library, test
programs, performance tracing software, documentation (a bit out-of-date), 
and an X windows-based visualization program.  

./armci contains code for the ARMCI one-sided remote memory operations.
It is used by GA as its run-time system.

./pario contains subdirectories with source for three parallel I/O 
libraries (DRA,EAF,SF). They build into libpario.a/pario.lib.

./lapack_blas contains source code for some of the LAPACK and most of
BLAS routines. In real applications, GA library should be linked
with LAPACK and BLAS libraries optimized for the given machine.

test programs.

./tcgmsg-mpi directory contains TCGMSG library implemented on top of MPI 

./ma directory contains MA library code with manpages and test programs.

./ga++ directory contains C++ bindings for global arrays. This is an optional
package that is built only if GA_C_CORE is defined as follows:
	setenv GA_C_CORE y

HOW TO RUN GA TEST PROGRAMS?  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Depends on the system. MPPs like Intel iPSC/860, Delta, Paragon, IBM
SPx, Cray T3/E have their own commands for submitting parallel jobs.

On workstations and clusters, GA are run like ordinary message-passing
programs:

  To run GA programs with MPI, you need to built the package to be compatible 
  with MPI (see README in ./global and documentation in ./global/doc/ ) 
  and run it as any other MPI program. 
  The GA package has been tested only with a limited number of MPI
  implementations (MPICH, and vendor's: Intel, IBM, Sun, HP, and SGI).  

  TCGMSG `parallel' command (built automaticaly in ./tcgmsg/ipcv4.0/parallel 
  if needed) is used to start a job on clusters if you are using TCGMSG
  as your message-passing library. On the workstations, GA-based programs
  that use TCGMSG can be run with a single process without the `parallel'
  command -- just by typing program name -- useful for debugging.
